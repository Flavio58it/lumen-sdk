Lumen Social Robot SDK
======================

The [Lumen Social Robot](http://lumen.lssk.ee.itb.ac.id/) is an ongoing research project of [LSKK (Control System and
Computers Laboratory)](http://lskk.ee.itb.ac.id/) of [STEI (School of Electrical and Informatics)](http://ee.itb.ac.id/),
[ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology Bandung, located in Indonesia)](http://www.itb.ac.id/).

This SDK (Software Development Kit) comprises the shared technical documentation and tools for Lumen researchers (and
any interested party). The SDK consists of two main parts:

1. [**Lumen Protocol**](doc/protocol/), which specifies how Lumen modules coordinate with each other
2. [**Programs and libraries**] to interact with Lumen modules that adheres to Lumen Protocol

Important: The SDK does currently *not* include all of the implementation modules themselves. These are individual
research projects which may opt to adhere to Lumen Protocol. Once available, they will be included to the SDK.

If you want to provide an implementation (java, C#, AngularJS/JavaScript) or anything of your choice, please contact a
project member.

Contributions from non-academic people are welcome, too.
