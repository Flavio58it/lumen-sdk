Lumen Social Robot SDK
======================

The [Lumen Social Robot](http://lumen.lssk.ee.itb.ac.id/) is an ongoing research project of [LSKK](http://lskk.ee.itb.ac.id/)
(Control System and Computers Laboratory) of [STEI](http://ee.itb.ac.id/) (School of Electrical and Informatics),
[ITB ](http://www.itb.ac.id/) (Bandung Institute of Technology Bandung, located in Indonesia).

This SDK (Software Development Kit) comprises the shared technical documentation and tools for Lumen researchers (and
any interested party). The SDK consists of two main parts:

1. [**Lumen Protocol**](http://lumenitb.github.io/lumen-sdk/protocol/), which specifies how Lumen modules coordinate with each other
2. libraries which implement the Lumen Protocol for a specific platform.
3. Sample applications and programs which use the libraries.

Important: The SDK is a work in progress. If you want to provide an implementation (java, C#, AngularJS/JavaScript) or
anything of your choice (e.g. a research project of yours), please contact a project member.

Contributions from non-academic people are welcome, too.
