Lumen Social Robot SDK
======================

The [Lumen Social Robot](http://lumen.lssk.ee.itb.ac.id/) is an ongoing research project of [LSKK (Control System and
Computers Laboratory)](http://lskk.ee.itb.ac.id/) of [STEI (School of Electrical and Informatics)](http://ee.itb.ac.id/),
[ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology Bandung, located in Indonesia)](http://www.itb.ac.id/).

This SDK (Software Development Kit) comprises the shared technical documentation and tools for Lumen researchers (and
any interested party). The SDK consists of two main parts:

1. [**Lumen Protocol**](doc/protocol.md), which specifies how Lumen modules coordinate with each other
2. libraries which implement the Lumen Protocol for a specific platform.
3. Sample applications and programs which use the libraries.

Important: The SDK is work in progress. If you want to provide an implementation (java, C#, AngularJS/JavaScript) or
anything of your choice (e.g. a research project of yours), please contact a project member.

Contributions from non-academic people are welcome, too.
